wooo hooo typing in nvim typing in nvim this is the dev log how should i organize it!!??

i cant wait till im a typing god ive been getting really into this shit at work and 
configuring all sorts of hotkeys and stuff. I like the focus it brings me. When I'm 
thousands and thousands of keystrokes deep and im focused on chunk 48 of the larger task
at hand I feel amazing and I get a ton done too.
